## Task 1: E-Commerce Cart Functionality

**Description**: A shopping cart allowing users to view and modify selected items.

### Features:
1. **Core Features**:
   - Cart represented as a JSON object with items (`name`, `price`, `quantity`, `category`).
   - Users can:
     - View the cart with item details.
     - Update item quantities, dynamically updating the total price using `forEach()` and `reduce()`.
     - Filter items by category using `filter()`.

2. **Extra Features**:
   - Apply a 10% discount if the total price exceeds a user-defined threshold.
   - Dynamically display the updated price.

3. **Technology**:
   - DOM manipulation for display and interactivity.

## Task 2: Employee Management Dashboard

**Description**: A dashboard for managing employee information.

### Features:
1. **Core Features**:
   - Employee data stored as an array of objects (`name`, `age`, `department`, `salary`).
   - Implementations:
     - Display the employee list using `for...in` or `for...of`.
     - Search for employees by name using string methods (`includes()` or `indexOf()`).
     - Filter employees by department using a dropdown and `filter()`.
     - Calculate the average salary using `reduce()`.

2. **Extra Features**:
   - Highlight employees earning more than a user-defined salary threshold using `map()`.

## Task 3: Fitness App Progress Tracker

**Description**: A tracker to monitor daily exercise and calorie burn.

### Features:
1. **Core Features**:
   - Daily progress represented as an object with `date`, `exercises` (array), and `totalCalories`.
   - Implementations:
     - Calculate total calories burned using `reduce()`.
     - Allow users to dynamically add exercises via a form and update total calories in real-time.
     - Search for exercises by name.

2. **Extra Features**:
   - Display a congratulatory message if total calories burned exceed 500 using a ternary operator.

## Task 4: Product Comparison Tool

**Description**: A tool for comparing different products.

### Features:
1. **Core Features**:
   - Product data represented as a JSON object (`name`, `price`, `rating`, `category`).
   - Implementations:
     - Display products dynamically using `forEach()`.
     - Filter products by:
       - Price range (`filter()`).
       - Category (using dropdown and conditional logic).

2. **Extra Features**:
   - Sort products by price or rating using `sort()`.
   - Display the cheapest and most expensive products using `Math.min()` and `Math.max()`.

## Task 5: Student Result Portal

**Description**: A portal for students to check their results.

### Features:
1. **Core Features**:
   - Student data stored as JSON objects with `name`, `marks` (object), and `averageMarks`.
   - Implementations:
     - Calculate average marks using `reduce()`.
     - Highlight students scoring above a user-defined threshold.
     - Display subject-wise marks dynamically using `for...in`.

2. **Extra Features**:
   - Search for students by name using string methods.
   - Display "Fail" message for students with an average below 40 using a ternary operator.

## Task 6: Real Estate Inquiry System

**Description**: A system to search for available properties.

### Features:
1. **Core Features**:
   - Property data stored as an array of objects (`location`, `price`, `type`, `availability`).
   - Implementations:
     - Display available properties using `map()`.
     - Filter properties by type or location using `filter()`.
     - Sort properties by price using a custom comparator.

2. **Extra Features**:
   - Use `while` and `do...while` loops to prompt the user for additional searches until they select "No".

## Task 7: Quiz App

**Description**: A simple quiz app to test JavaScript knowledge.

### Features:
1. **Core Features**:
   - Questions represented as an array of objects (`text`, `options`, `correctAnswer`, `userAnswer`).
   - Implementations:
     - Display questions one by one using a `for` loop.
     - Allow users to select answers using radio buttons.
     - Calculate the score using `reduce()`.

2. **Extra Features**:
   - Highlight incorrect answers in red and correct answers in green using DOM manipulation.
